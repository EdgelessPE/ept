# Path

[//]: # (This file is automatically generated by script, do not modify it.)

import Tag from "../../../components/tag.tsx"

Expose executable files/folders to the PATH:
If an executable file is specified, an entry will be created in the unified managed bin directory;
If a folder is specified, it will be added to the PATH variable.

## Fields
### record
Record value, supports executable files/folders, supports relative and absolute paths.
* Type: `String`  
* Example:
  ```toml
  # Create entry for executable file
  record = "visual-studio-code.exe"
  
  # Add folder to PATH variable
  record = "./bin"
  ``` 
* Validation rules:
  * Is a valid path
### alias
<Tag>Optional</Tag> Alias, only effective for executable files, defaults to the original filename.
* Type: `String`  
* Example: `alias = "code.exe"`  
## Reverse Steps
Remove the generated executable file entry or remove the directory from the PATH variable.
## Manifest
* If `record` points to a relative path, that path enters the manifest
